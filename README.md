# Hi there everyone!
#
# This is a scientific machine learning experimental site for
# 
# AI-supported aging for pandemic-resilient digital infrastructure. 
#
# KISAT is developing methods for the long-term safeguarding of digital infrastructure to function reliably under pandemic conditions.
#
# Tasks are: 
# - Capture and assess the security as-is state of aging IoT and infrastructure components, 
# - Develop new methods for the long-term protection of legacy equipment, such as devices that can no longer be patched, 
#   using IT security and machine learning methods, 
# - Design and implementation of KISAT software tools, 
# - Publication and presentation of KISAT at national and international conferences and in professional journals.

# Sapere aude!
#
# (Sapere aude is a Latin proverb and means Dare to be wise! 
# It is most often quoted in the interpretation of Immanuel Kant, who declared it the motto of the Enlightenment in 1784:
# "Have courage to use your own understanding!")
#
# 
# Have fun with your challenges and always remember: yolo or, memento mori.
